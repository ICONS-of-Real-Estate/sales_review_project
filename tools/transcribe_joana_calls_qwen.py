"""
Cheaper alternative to transcribe_joana_calls.py, using Alibaba's
Qwen3-ASR-Flash instead of Gemini — same trade-off as
transcribe_sean_calls_qwen.py (no speaker diarization; see that file's
docstring for the full reasoning). Reuses the Drive plumbing from
transcribe_sean_calls.py, the Qwen CLI wrapper from
transcribe_sean_calls_qwen.py, and the JOANA_FOLDERS placeholder from
transcribe_joana_calls.py, so there is exactly one place to fill in her
Drive folder ID(s) once known.

Setup: same as transcribe_sean_calls_qwen.py (qwen3-asr-toolkit + ffmpeg on
PATH + DASHSCOPE_API_KEY).
